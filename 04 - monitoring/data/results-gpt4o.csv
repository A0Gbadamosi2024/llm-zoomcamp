"To structure your questions and answers for the course, consider the following approach:

1. **Be Clear and Concise:** Ensure your questions are specific and directly related to the course material or processes.
   
2. **Use Relevant Context:** Reference information from the course FAQ to enhance understanding. For example, if you have a question about the course duration, note that it is approximately 4 months, and additional activities might extend that time.

3. **Categorization:** Organize your questions into categories, such as course length, accessing materials, time commitment, and miscellaneous topics.

4. **Follow-Up Questions:** After asking a primary question, anticipate related questions. For instance, if you inquire about course materials, you might also ask about how to access different resources, which can lead to further insights.

5. **Consider Technology:** If your question pertains to programming languages, clarify which languages are advisable for course assignments, as certain tasks may require specific tools (e.g., Python 3.10).

By utilizing these strategies, your questions and answers will be more structured and informative.","Machine Learning Zoomcamp FAQ

"The course will cover theory only at an intuitive level, focusing more on practical applications.

"No, prior knowledge in math is not necessary for this course. While some linear algebra will be covered, the course will mostly focus on code with very few formulas.

Here are some interesting videos covering linear algebra that you can already watch: ML Zoomcamp 1.8 - Linear Algebra Refresher from Alexey Grigorev or the excellent playlist from 3Blue1Brown Vectors | Chapter 1, Essence of linear algebra. Never hesitate to ask the community for help if you have any question.
