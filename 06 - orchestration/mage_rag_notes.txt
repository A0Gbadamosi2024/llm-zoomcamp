SOLVING RAG Pipeline Issues with Mage on GitHub Codespaces

A. JSON Decode Error : When reading in the documents.json in the ingest block 
Use the URL to the raw file in the github repository and not the direct file link to avoid a JSON decode error . 

B. Elasticsearch exits unexpectedly :To solve problems in Github Codespaces where elastic search exits unexpectedly , you can change your codespaces configuration 
to the "8 cores 16 GB RAM configuration". This is still free but you may use up your free hours faster. 

C. Elasticsearch connection refused or Authentication Error: To solve connection refused errors when trying to export te spacy embeddings to elastic search 

    change the connection string to http://<elastic_search_servicename>:9200
    i.e if your docker-compose.yml file runs the elastic search service as : 

    '''  elasticsearch:
        image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.5.0
        environment:
        - discovery.type=single-node
        - xpack.security.enabled=false
        ports:
        - "9200:9200"
        - "9300:9300"
        restart: always
        networks:
        - app-network '''

    Your CONNECTION STRING should be `http://elasticsearch:9200`
